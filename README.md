# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# 🧑‍💻 Gurnoor – Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio (Assignment 14)

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React** to showcase the work, skills, and projects I’ve done during my Full Stack Web Development diploma.

It includes:

- React (Create React App)
- Dockerized deployment on port `5575`
- Pre-commit checks with Husky
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

---

## 🧪 Local Development (Before Docker)

### Clone or open your project, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm start

Install ESLint and Prettier:

npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
npx eslint --init

To format  code manually:
npx prettier --write .

To dockerise:
docker build -t gurnoor_coding_assignment14 .
docker run -d -p 5575:80 --name gurnoor_coding_assignment14 gurnoor_coding_assignment14


tester
```
